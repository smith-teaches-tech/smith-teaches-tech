# 👋 Hi, I'm Michael — an English teacher who builds simple, useful tools for learning

I'm a high school English teacher who likes to create low-tech edtech. Most of what I build is lightweight: fast-loading HTML games and interactive practice tools that students can open without logins.

These aren’t fancy "apps" — they're small, standards-based activities that solve very specific learning needs. My goal is to keep developing these into clearer, more flexible and robust tools, and eventually move into more complex programs.

### 🎮 Classroom Games (GitHub Pages)
Right now I'm building out a growing collection of focused browser-based games and practice tools:

👉 **https://smith-teaches-tech.github.io/classroom-games/**

Examples include:
- AP Lang transitions and syntax games  
- TOK knowledge/perspective practice tools  
- Extended Essay structure + RQ builders  
- Vocabulary and grammar games for English learners  

They're all simple HTML/CSS/JS, but they help my students practice things we struggle to get enough reps on in class.

### 🧪 What I Teach
- **AP Language & Composition**  
- **AP Research**  
- **Theory of Knowledge (TOK)**  
- **Extended Essay**  
- **English language learning**  

### 🔧 What I'm Building
- HTML games for rhetoric, grammar, vocabulary, and reasoning  
- TOK and EE concept simulators (claims, perspectives, RQs, LoR)  
- Writing process tools + interactive diagnostics  
- Clean, fast, teacher-friendly learning materials  
- Early experiments combining AI + pedagogy (ethically and transparently)  

### 🎯 Why I Build This Stuff
Because students need more *practice*, not more platforms they need to login to.  
If a 12-line JavaScript file can help them get reps with matching evidence to claims, then great — build it, test it, and improve it.

### 🌱 Long-term
I want to keep expanding these tools, make them more robust, and eventually broaden them to include more authentic inquiry-based tasks.
